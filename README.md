3D-Synthetic-Data:
This is the project page for our research "    [supplemetary]

We will also update latest progress and available sources to this repository~ 

# Note
This repository contains PyTorch implementations of the paper 'Accurate 2D Facial Depth Models Derived from a 3D Synthetic Dataset' on our new high quality generated 3D synthetic dataset along with training on https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth.

# Requirements
pip install...:
keras, Pillow, matplotlib, opencv-python, scikit-image, sklearn, pathlib, pandas, -U efficientnet, 
pip install https://www.github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.git, torch, torchvision

# Data
The datasets are released and can be downloaded from the following link...

# Testing
python test.py

# Evaluation
python eval.py

# Training
Once the dataset is ready, you can train the network using following command.
python train.py

# Modified https://www.github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.git
open the FaceDepth directory 
# Testing
python Facedepth_test.py

This will save results into the 'pre_syn_test' folder

# Evaluation
python eval.py

# Training
Once the dataset is ready, you can train the network using following command.(<-- two spaces)
python train.py
